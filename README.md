# 📚 Automated Book Publication Workflow
> *AI-powered, agentic, RL-enhanced, human-in-the-loop content pipeline*

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is an **end-to-end, agentic AI workflow** designed to automate the publication pipeline of book chapters. It demonstrates:

✅ Web scraping & screenshots  
✅ AI rewriting and reviewing (LLM-powered)  
✅ RL-style reward optimization  
✅ Human-in-the-loop editing  
✅ Versioning with semantic search  
✅ Voice output generation

---

## 🎯 Objective

> Create a system that fetches content from a web URL, applies AI-driven rewriting ("spin"), allows multiple human-in-the-loop iterations, and ensures consistent, version-controlled, searchable results with voice support.

**Key capabilities:**
- ✅ Scraping & screenshots with RL-based rewards
- ✅ AI Writer & Reviewer loops
- ✅ Human editing stage
- ✅ Version storage and semantic search
- ✅ Text-to-speech audio generation
